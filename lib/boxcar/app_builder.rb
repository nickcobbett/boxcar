# The purpose of this class is to provide the building blocks that are used for generating a rails
# app. For example, the readme method is responsible for creating the readme file. Since we're
# inheriting from Rails::AppBuilder, we have a lot of those building blocks set up for us already.
# We can override those methods to customize how they work, or we can create new ones.
